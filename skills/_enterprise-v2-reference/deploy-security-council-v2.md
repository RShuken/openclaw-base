# Deploy Security Council v2

> **📌 REFERENCE SNAPSHOT — NOT FOR DEFAULT DEPLOYMENT.** This file was preserved from the {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} / {{COMPANY_NAME}} engagement as a reference example of how a custom office/VC deployment was built. **Do NOT install this skill as part of a generic OpenClaw deployment.** It may contain engagement-specific defaults (emails, chat IDs, team names, VC-flavored workflows), Claude Opus routing (we default to Codex per `audit/_baseline.md` §BB in the parent repo), or stale "Blocked Commands" claims from 2026.2.26 that were resolved in 2026.4.15+. Use as inspiration when building custom-office skills, not as a default.

## Compatibility
- **OpenClaw Version**: 2026.2.26+
- **Status**: READY
- **Architecture**: Standalone (no OpenClaw CLI dependencies for scheduling, config, or model routing)
- **Platform**: macOS (launchd). Adaptable to Linux (systemd timers) or Windows (schtasks).
- **Replaces**: `deploy-security-council.md` (BLOCKED -- referenced 6 nonexistent CLI commands and required a separate API key through the wrong mechanism)

## Purpose

Install a nightly 4-perspective AI security review that runs as a standalone system on the client's machine. Four specialized security personas analyze the system baseline independently, an operational realism filter removes false positives, and findings are deduplicated against the last 7 days before delivery via Telegram (summary) and optionally email (full HTML report).

This is a **standalone script architecture** -- it does NOT run inside an OpenClaw session. Running inside a session would cause context overflow on large baselines. Instead, `security-council.js` calls the Anthropic API directly using the client's API key stored in a local `.env` file.

**When to use:** After the core workspace is set up on any machine with a codebase to protect. Provides ongoing, multi-perspective security oversight without manual effort.

**What this skill does:**
1. Creates security-council config and data directories
2. Stores API keys (Anthropic for Claude analysis) and Telegram credentials
3. Installs 4 security persona prompt files
4. Installs baseline collection script (`collect-baseline.sh`)
5. Installs orchestrator script (`security-council.js`) -- standalone, calls Claude API directly
6. Installs HTML report renderer (`render-security-email.js`)
7. Initializes SQLite database (runs, findings, persona_outputs)
8. Schedules nightly execution at 3:30 AM via launchd
9. Runs verification: test review, SQLite storage, Telegram delivery, dedup confirmation

## How Commands Are Sent

This skill is executed by an operator who has an active remote session.
See `_deploy-common.md` -> "Command Delivery" for the full protocol.

- **Remote:** commands sent via `POST /api/sessions/${SESSION_ID}/commands` or device exec API
- **Operator:** commands run on the operator's local terminal

## Variables

Resolve these before executing. Sources are listed for each.

| Variable | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `${WORKSPACE}` | Client profile: workspace path | `~/clawd/` |
| `${SESSION_ID}` | Session polling or creation | `sess_abc123` |
| `${DEVICE_ID}` | Device enrollment | `dev_xyz789` |
| `${BEARER}` | Operator login response | `eyJhbG...` |
| `${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}` | Operator: client's Anthropic API key | `sk-ant-api03-...` |
| `${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}` | Client profile: agent bot token | `7123456789:AAF...` |
| `${TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID}` | Client profile: client's Telegram user ID | `{{PRINCIPAL_CHAT_ID}}` |
| `${TIMEZONE}` | Client profile: timezone | `America/Denver` |
| `${AGENT_USER}` | `whoami` on client machine | `edge` |
| `${AGENT_HOME}` | Home directory resolved from `${AGENT_USER}` | `/Users/edge` |
| `${EMAIL_RECIPIENT}` | Client profile: email for HTML reports (optional) | `principal@example.com` |

## Before You Start

Follow the **Standard Deployment Protocol** in `_deploy-common.md`: read the client profile, check what exists, identify adaptations, and present a deployment plan before executing.

**Pre-flight checks for this skill:**

Check if the security council is already deployed:

**Remote:**
```
ls ${WORKSPACE}/security-council/ 2>/dev/null && echo 'EXISTS' || echo 'NOT_DEPLOYED'
```

Check if Node.js is available and verify version:

**Remote:**
```
node --version && npm --version
```

Expected: Node.js v18+ and npm. If not installed, install Node.js first.

Check if SQLite3 is available (needed by better-sqlite3 npm package):

**Remote:**
```
which sqlite3 && sqlite3 --version
```

Check if himalaya is available for optional HTML email delivery:

**Remote:**
```
which himalaya 2>/dev/null && echo 'AVAILABLE' || echo 'NOT_INSTALLED'
```

Check if the Anthropic API key is valid:

**Remote:**
```
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -H "x-api-key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}" -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say OK"}]}' https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
```

Expected: `200`. If `401`, the key is invalid. If `429`, rate limited (try again).

**Decision points from pre-flight:**
- Is the security council already deployed? If so, decide whether to update or skip.
- Is himalaya available? If not, email delivery will be skipped (Telegram-only).
- Is the Anthropic API key a standard key (`sk-ant-api03-`)? OAuth tokens (`sk-ant-oat01-`) do NOT work for direct API calls.

## Adaptation Points

| Component | Default | Customize When... |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Base directory | `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/` | Client wants a different location |
| Database path | `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/data/security-council.db` | Client wants DBs in a shared location |
| Schedule | 3:30 AM local time | Client prefers different time |
| Dedup window | 7 days | Client wants longer/shorter memory |
| Personas | All 4 (offensive, defensive, data-privacy, operational-realism) | Simpler system may not need all |
| Email delivery | Disabled (Telegram only) unless himalaya is present | Client wants full HTML email reports |
| Model | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Client has Opus access or prefers a different model |
| Baseline checks | Full suite | Some checks may not apply (e.g., no gateway) |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+ and npm installed
- Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-api03-` prefix -- NOT an OAuth token)
- Telegram bot token and chat ID configured
- `${WORKSPACE}` directory exists
- macOS (for launchd scheduling -- adapt for Linux/Windows per `_deploy-common.md`)

## Steps

### Phase 1: Configuration

#### 1.1 Create Directory Structure `[AUTO]`

Create the security council directory tree for scripts, data, personas, and logs.

**Remote:**
```
mkdir -p ${WORKSPACE}/security-council/{scripts,data,personas,logs}
```

Expected: Four directories created under `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/`.

If already exists: Safe to re-run. `mkdir -p` is idempotent.

#### 1.2 Create Environment File with API Keys `[HUMAN_INPUT]`

Store the Anthropic API key and Telegram credentials in a `.env` file. This file is read by the standalone security-council.js script at runtime.

**Important:** Validate the API key format before writing. It MUST start with `sk-ant-api03-`. OAuth tokens (`sk-ant-oat01-`) will NOT work for direct API calls.

**Remote:**
```
cat > ${WORKSPACE}/security-council/.env << ENV_EOF
# Security Council Configuration
# Generated by deploy-security-council-v2

# Anthropic API Key (required -- must be sk-ant-api03-* format)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}

# Model selection
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Telegram alerts
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=${TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID}

# Email (optional -- requires himalaya)
EMAIL_RECIPIENT=${EMAIL_RECIPIENT}

# Dedup window in days
DEDUP_WINDOW_DAYS=7

# Timezone
TZ=${TIMEZONE}
ENV_EOF
```

**Note:** This heredoc uses an UNQUOTED delimiter so `${VARIABLES}` are expanded by the operator's shell before sending. The operator must substitute literal values into the command string before sending via the API.

Expected: File exists at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/.env` with all values populated.

If this fails: Check that the parent directory exists. Verify variable substitution happened correctly.

If already exists: Back up as `.env.bak` and write new version.

#### 1.3 Restrict .env File Permissions `[AUTO]`

Lock down the `.env` file so only the owner can read it. This file contains API keys.

**Remote:**
```
chmod 600 ${WORKSPACE}/security-council/.env
```

Expected: File permissions are `-rw-------`.

#### 1.4 Add .env to .gitignore `[AUTO]`

Ensure the `.env` file is not tracked by git. Check the workspace-level `.gitignore` and the security-council-level `.gitignore`.

**Remote:**
```
grep -q 'security-council/.env' ${WORKSPACE}/.gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo 'security-council/.env' >> ${WORKSPACE}/.gitignore
```

**Remote:**
```
printf '.env\ndata/\nlogs/\nnode_modules/\n' > ${WORKSPACE}/security-council/.gitignore
```

Expected: `.env`, `data/`, `logs/`, and `node_modules/` are gitignored.

If already exists: Idempotent -- grep prevents duplicate entries.

### Phase 2: Persona Installation

#### 2.1 Install Offensive Security Persona `[AUTO]`

Write the offensive security expert persona prompt file. This persona thinks like an attacker and looks for exploitable weaknesses.

**Remote:**

Write the following content to `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/personas/offensive-security.md`:

```
# Offensive Security Analyst

You are a senior penetration tester and red team operator. Your job is to find exploitable vulnerabilities in this system before a real attacker does.

## Your Mindset
- Think like an attacker with network access to this machine
- Assume the attacker knows the system is running OpenClaw/AI agent software
- Look for the easiest path to compromise, not the most exotic

## What You Analyze
Given the system baseline data, examine:

1. **Exposed Ports & Services**: Any port bound to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1 is internet-reachable. Identify services that should be loopback-only.
2. **Weak Authentication**: Default credentials, missing auth on APIs, tokens in environment variables without rotation policy.
3. **Prompt Injection Vectors**: AI agent configs that accept untrusted input. System prompts that can be overridden. Tool calls that execute arbitrary commands.
4. **Credential Leaks**: API keys in git history, .env files with overly broad permissions, tokens logged to stdout, secrets in process arguments visible via `ps`.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Writable scripts that run as cron/launchd jobs, SUID binaries, npm packages with postinstall scripts.
6. **Supply Chain**: Outdated npm packages with known CVEs, unverified dependencies, missing lockfile integrity.

## Output Format
Return a JSON array of findings. Each finding:
{
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "title": "Short descriptive title",
  "description": "What the vulnerability is and why it matters",
  "evidence": "Specific line/config/output that proves this finding",
  "recommendation": "Concrete fix action"
}

Be specific. Reference exact file paths, port numbers, package names. No vague warnings.
Only report findings you can support with evidence from the baseline data.
```

Expected: File exists at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/personas/offensive-security.md`.

If already exists: Compare content. If unchanged, skip. If different, back up as `.bak` and write new version.

#### 2.2 Install Defensive Security Persona `[AUTO]`

Write the defensive security expert persona prompt file. This persona reviews protection mechanisms and hardening status.

**Remote:**

Write the following content to `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/personas/defensive-security.md`:

```
# Defensive Security Analyst

You are a systems hardening specialist and security architect. Your job is to verify that protective controls are properly configured and comprehensive.

## Your Mindset
- Defense in depth: no single control should be the only barrier
- Compliance-aware but practical -- focus on real protection, not checkbox security
- Assume attackers will find exposed services; verify controls limit blast radius

## What You Analyze
Given the system baseline data, examine:

1. **Firewall Status**: Is the macOS firewall enabled? Are rules appropriate? Any unnecessary exceptions?
2. **Disk Encryption**: Is FileVault enabled? Are database files on encrypted volumes?
3. **Access Controls**: File permissions on sensitive directories (~/.openclaw, workspace, .env files). Are they owner-only (600/700)?
4. **Update Status**: Are OS, Node.js, npm packages current? Are there pending security updates?
5. **Backup Integrity**: Do backups exist? Are they encrypted? Are they stored off-machine?
6. **Network Segmentation**: Is the gateway bound to loopback? Are services properly isolated?
7. **Logging & Monitoring**: Are security-relevant events logged? Are logs protected from tampering?
8. **TLS/Encryption**: Are API calls using HTTPS? Are any connections unencrypted?

## Output Format
Return a JSON array of findings. Each finding:
{
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "title": "Short descriptive title",
  "description": "What control is missing or misconfigured",
  "evidence": "Specific configuration, permission, or status that proves this finding",
  "recommendation": "Concrete remediation step"
}

Be thorough but avoid duplicating offensive findings. Focus on what protections SHOULD exist but are missing or weak.
```

Expected: File exists at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/personas/defensive-security.md`.

If already exists: Compare content. If unchanged, skip. If different, back up as `.bak` and write new version.

#### 2.3 Install Data Privacy Persona `[AUTO]`

Write the data privacy expert persona prompt file. This persona focuses on PII exposure, data retention, and scoping.

**Remote:**

Write the following content to `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/personas/data-privacy.md`:

```
# Data Privacy Analyst

You are a data privacy specialist focused on PII protection, data minimization, and regulatory compliance. Your job is to find places where sensitive data is exposed, retained too long, or scoped too broadly.

## Your Mindset
- Every piece of PII is a liability if exposed
- Logs are the #1 source of accidental data leaks
- AI systems are especially prone to ingesting and storing data they should not have access to
- Think GDPR/CCPA principles even if not legally required -- they represent good practice

## What You Analyze
Given the system baseline data, examine:

1. **PII in Logs**: Are names, emails, phone numbers, or addresses appearing in log files? Check application logs, cron logs, and system logs.
2. **Credential Files**: .env files, API key files, OAuth tokens. Are they properly scoped (minimal permissions)? Are there stale credentials that should be rotated?
3. **Memory & Context Dumps**: AI memory/context files that may contain conversation data with PII. Are these encrypted at rest?
4. **Data Retention**: How long are logs, database records, and cached data kept? Is there an automatic cleanup policy?
5. **Notion/Email Scoping**: If the agent has access to Notion or email, is it scoped to specific workspaces/labels or does it have broad access?
6. **Git History**: Are there commits that accidentally included secrets or PII that were later removed but remain in history?
7. **Database Content**: SQLite databases that store contact info, meeting notes, or personal data. Are they encrypted? Who can access them?
8. **Process Arguments**: Are API keys or tokens visible in `ps` output via command-line arguments?

## Output Format
Return a JSON array of findings. Each finding:
{
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "title": "Short descriptive title",
  "description": "What data privacy issue exists and its impact",
  "evidence": "Specific file, log entry, or configuration that proves this finding",
  "recommendation": "Concrete remediation step with data minimization focus"
}

Severity guide for privacy:
- critical: Active PII exposure (keys in logs, unencrypted PII databases accessible remotely)
- high: PII stored without encryption or with excessive retention
- medium: Overly broad data access scoping, missing cleanup policies
- low: Minor scoping improvements, documentation gaps
```

Expected: File exists at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/personas/data-privacy.md`.

If already exists: Compare content. If unchanged, skip. If different, back up as `.bak` and write new version.

#### 2.4 Install Operational Realism Persona `[AUTO]`

Write the operational realism persona prompt file. This is the false-positive filter -- it assesses practical impact and blast radius.

**Remote:**

Write the following content to `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/personas/operational-realism.md`:

```
# Operational Realism Analyst

You are a pragmatic security operations lead. Your job is to take the raw findings from other security analysts and filter them through the lens of practical reality. You eliminate false positives, assess actual blast radius, and prioritize what matters for THIS specific system.

## Your Mindset
- Not every finding is actionable or important
- Context matters: a "critical" finding on a loopback-only service is medium at best
- The client is a single developer or small team -- security advice must be proportional
- A Mac Mini behind a home/office router has a different threat model than a cloud server
- Time spent fixing low-value findings is time not spent on high-value ones

## What You Analyze
You receive the combined findings from the offensive, defensive, and data privacy analysts, along with the original baseline data. For each finding, assess:

1. **Is this a real risk for THIS system?** A Mac Mini on a private network is not the same as a public cloud server. Adjust severity accordingly.
2. **What is the actual blast radius?** If this vulnerability were exploited, what exactly would an attacker gain? Access to the whole machine? Just one API key? A read-only database?
3. **Is this a false positive?** Sometimes baseline data is ambiguous. A port showing as LISTEN on 0.0.0.0 might actually be filtered by the OS firewall. A file permission of 644 on a non-sensitive file is not a finding.
4. **What is the effort-to-impact ratio?** A 5-minute fix for a high-impact issue should be prioritized. A 2-hour fix for a cosmetic issue should not.
5. **Are there duplicate or overlapping findings?** Multiple analysts may flag the same underlying issue from different angles. Consolidate.

## Output Format
Return a JSON object with two sections:

{
  "validated_findings": [
    {
      "original_severity": "high",
      "adjusted_severity": "medium",
      "title": "Original finding title",
      "rationale": "Why severity was adjusted (or kept)",
      "blast_radius": "What an attacker actually gains",
      "effort_to_fix": "low|medium|high",
      "recommendation": "Practical, proportional fix"
    }
  ],
  "dismissed_findings": [
    {
      "title": "Finding that was dismissed",
      "rationale": "Why this is a false positive or not actionable for this system"
    }
  ]
}

Be honest. If the other analysts found real problems, validate them. But do not let noise crowd out signal.
```

Expected: File exists at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/personas/operational-realism.md`.

If already exists: Compare content. If unchanged, skip. If different, back up as `.bak` and write new version.

### Phase 3: Script Installation

#### 3.1 Install Baseline Collection Script `[GUIDED]`

Write the `collect-baseline.sh` script that gathers system state for the security personas to analyze. This script runs locally and outputs a structured text report.

**Remote:**

Write the following content to `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/scripts/collect-baseline.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# collect-baseline.sh -- Gather system security baseline for AI analysis
# Part of Security Council v2
# Runs locally, outputs structured text to stdout

Make it executable:

**Remote:**

chmod +x ${WORKSPACE}/security-council/scripts/collect-baseline.sh
```

Expected: Script exists and is executable at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/scripts/collect-baseline.sh`.

If this fails: Check that the scripts directory exists (Phase 1.1).

If already exists: Compare content. If unchanged, skip. If different, back up as `.bak` and write new version.

#### 3.2 Install Security Council Orchestrator `[GUIDED]`

Write the `security-council.js` orchestrator script. This is the core of the system.

**Critical design decisions:**
- **STANDALONE**: Does NOT use `openclaw agent` or any OpenClaw CLI. Calls the Anthropic API directly via `fetch`.
- **Sequential persona execution**: Each persona runs one at a time to manage API rate limits and keep context clear. The operational realism persona runs LAST because it needs the other three personas' findings as input.
- **SQLite dedup**: Findings are compared against the last 7 days by title + description hash. Only new findings are reported.
- **Immediate critical alerts**: Any `critical` severity finding triggers an immediate Telegram message, not batched with the rest.

**Remote:**

Write the following content to `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/scripts/security-council.js`:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

Make it executable:

**Remote:**
```
chmod +x ${WORKSPACE}/security-council/scripts/security-council.js
```

Expected: Script exists and is executable at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/scripts/security-council.js`.

If this fails: Check that the scripts directory exists (Phase 1.1).

If already exists: Compare content. If unchanged, skip. If different, back up as `.bak` and write new version.

#### 3.3 Install HTML Report Renderer `[AUTO]`

Write the `render-security-email.js` template module. This produces a self-contained HTML report with color-coded severity badges, executive summary, detailed findings, and trend analysis.

**Remote:**

Write the following content to `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/scripts/render-security-email.js`:

};
```

Expected: File exists at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/scripts/render-security-email.js`.

If already exists: Compare content. If unchanged, skip. If different, back up as `.bak` and write new version.

#### 3.4 Install package.json and Dependencies `[GUIDED]`

Create the `package.json` for the security council project and install dependencies.

**Remote:**

Write the following content to `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "security-council",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "description": "Nightly 4-perspective AI security review system",
  "scripts": {
    "review": "node scripts/security-council.js",
    "review:dry": "node scripts/security-council.js --dry-run --json",
    "baseline": "bash scripts/collect-baseline.sh"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "better-sqlite3": "^11.0.0"
  }
}
```

Install dependencies:

**Remote:**
```
cd ${WORKSPACE}/security-council && npm install
```

Expected: `node_modules/` directory created with `better-sqlite3` compiled. No errors.

If this fails: `better-sqlite3` requires a C++ compiler (Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS). If the build fails:
- Check: `xcode-select -p` -- if it returns an error, the client must install Xcode CLT
- On macOS: `xcode-select --install` (requires GUI interaction from the client)
- Alternative: Try `npm install better-sqlite3 --build-from-source`

If already exists: `npm install` is safe to re-run. It updates packages if needed.

### Phase 4: Database Setup

#### 4.1 Initialize SQLite Database `[AUTO]`

The database is auto-created when `security-council.js` first runs (the schema is embedded in the script). However, we verify it initializes correctly by running a quick test.

**Remote:**
```
cd ${WORKSPACE}/security-council && node -e "
  var Database = require('better-sqlite3');
  var path = require('path');
  var db = new Database(path.join('data', 'security-council.db'));
  db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
  db.exec(
    'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS runs (' +
    '  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,' +
    '  started_at TEXT NOT NULL,' +
    '  completed_at TEXT,' +
    '  status TEXT DEFAULT \'running\',' +
    '  baseline_hash TEXT,' +
    '  total_findings INTEGER DEFAULT 0,' +
    '  new_findings INTEGER DEFAULT 0,' +
    '  critical_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,' +
    '  high_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,' +
    '  medium_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,' +
    '  low_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0' +
    ');' +
    'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS findings (' +
    '  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,' +
    '  run_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES runs(id),' +
    '  persona TEXT NOT NULL,' +
    '  severity TEXT NOT NULL,' +
    '  title TEXT NOT NULL,' +
    '  description TEXT NOT NULL,' +
    '  evidence TEXT,' +
    '  recommendation TEXT,' +
    '  content_hash TEXT NOT NULL,' +
    '  is_new INTEGER DEFAULT 1,' +
    '  adjusted_severity TEXT,' +
    '  blast_radius TEXT,' +
    '  effort_to_fix TEXT,' +
    '  dismissed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,' +
    '  dismiss_rationale TEXT,' +
    '  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime(\'now\')),' +
    '  UNIQUE(run_id, content_hash)' +
    ');' +
    'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS persona_outputs (' +
    '  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,' +
    '  run_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES runs(id),' +
    '  persona TEXT NOT NULL,' +
    '  raw_response TEXT,' +
    '  parsed_findings_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,' +
    '  tokens_used INTEGER DEFAULT 0,' +
    '  duration_ms INTEGER DEFAULT 0,' +
    '  error TEXT,' +
    '  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime(\'now\'))' +
    ');' +
    'CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_findings_hash ON findings(content_hash);' +
    'CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_findings_run ON findings(run_id);' +
    'CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_findings_severity ON findings(severity);'
  );
  var tables = db.prepare('SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type=\'table\'').all();
  console.log('Tables: ' + tables.map(function(t) { return t.name; }).join(', '));
  db.close();
  console.log('Database initialized successfully.');
"
```

Expected: Output shows `Tables: runs, findings, persona_outputs` and `Database initialized successfully.`

If this fails: Check that `better-sqlite3` is installed and the `data/` directory exists.

### Phase 5: Scheduling

#### 5.1 Create launchd Plist for Nightly Execution `[GUIDED]`

Schedule the security council to run nightly at 3:30 AM local time using launchd. **Level 1 -- exact syntax required** because launchd plists must be precise and `~` is not expanded.

**Important:** launchd requires absolute paths. `~` and `$HOME` are NOT expanded in plist files. Use `/Users/${AGENT_USER}/...` for all paths.

**Remote:**

Write the following content to `${AGENT_HOME}/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rel.security-council.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.rel.security-council</string>

    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/node</string>
        <string>${AGENT_HOME}/clawd/security-council/scripts/security-council.js</string>
    </array>

    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>${AGENT_HOME}/clawd/security-council</string>

    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
        <key>PATH</key>
        <string>/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</string>
        <key>HOME</key>
        <string>${AGENT_HOME}</string>
        <key>WORKSPACE_DIR</key>
        <string>${AGENT_HOME}/clawd</string>
    </dict>

    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
    <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>3</integer>
        <key>Minute</key>
        <integer>30</integer>
    </dict>

    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>${AGENT_HOME}/clawd/security-council/logs/launchd-stdout.log</string>

    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>${AGENT_HOME}/clawd/security-council/logs/launchd-stderr.log</string>

    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <false/>

    <key>Nice</key>
    <integer>10</integer>
</dict>
</plist>
```

**Critical Notes:**
- Replace `${AGENT_HOME}` with the actual absolute path (e.g., `/Users/edge`) in the plist. The operator MUST substitute this before sending.
- The `node` path may differ. Check with `which node` on the target machine. On Mac Mini M4 Pro with Homebrew, it is typically `/opt/homebrew/bin/node`. Adjust the `ProgramArguments` accordingly.
- `StartCalendarInterval` uses local time (respects the system timezone). No UTC conversion needed.
- `Nice` value of 10 gives it lower priority so it does not interfere with interactive use.

#### 5.2 Verify Node Path and Adjust Plist `[AUTO]`

Before loading the plist, verify the node binary path on the target machine.

**Remote:**
```
which node
```

Expected: Path to node binary (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/node` on Apple Silicon, `/usr/local/bin/node` on Intel). If it differs from what is in the plist, update the plist before loading.

#### 5.3 Load the LaunchAgent `[GUIDED]`

Register the launchd agent. **Level 1 -- exact syntax required.**

First check if already loaded:

**Remote:**
```
launchctl list 2>/dev/null | grep com.rel.security-council && echo 'ALREADY_LOADED' || echo 'NOT_LOADED'
```

If `NOT_LOADED`:

**Remote:**
```
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ${AGENT_HOME}/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rel.security-council.plist
```

If `ALREADY_LOADED` and the plist was updated:

**Remote:**
```
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.rel.security-council
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ${AGENT_HOME}/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rel.security-council.plist
```

Expected: No error output. The agent is registered and will run at 3:30 AM daily.

If this fails:
- `Operation already in progress`: The agent is already loaded. Use bootout/bootstrap to reload.
- `Path had bad ownership/permissions`: The plist file must be owned by the user. Check `ls -la` on the plist file.
- `No such file or directory`: The plist path is wrong. Check `${AGENT_HOME}/Library/LaunchAgents/` exists.

#### 5.4 Verify LaunchAgent Registration `[AUTO]`

Confirm the agent is registered and will fire at the expected time.

**Remote:**
```
launchctl list | grep com.rel.security-council
```

Expected: A line showing the agent label with a PID of `-` (not currently running) and exit status `0` (or `-` if never run).

### Phase 6: Verification

#### 6.1 Run a Test Security Review `[GUIDED]`

Execute a full security review in dry-run mode to validate the entire pipeline: baseline collection, persona analysis, dedup, and report generation.

**Remote:**
```
cd ${WORKSPACE}/security-council && node scripts/security-council.js --dry-run --json 2>&1
```

Expected: JSON output containing findings from all four perspectives with severity, title, description, evidence, and recommendation fields. The run should complete in 2-10 minutes depending on baseline size and API response times.

If this fails:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set`: Check the `.env` file exists and has the correct key
- `better-sqlite3 not installed`: Run `npm install` in the security-council directory
- `collect-baseline.sh not found`: Verify the script exists and is executable
- API timeout: The model may be slow. Try again or increase the timeout
- Parse errors: Check the logs at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/logs/security-council.log` for raw API responses

#### 6.2 Verify SQLite Storage `[AUTO]`

Confirm that the test run was stored correctly in the database.

**Remote:**
```
cd ${WORKSPACE}/security-council && node -e "
  var Database = require('better-sqlite3');
  var db = new Database('data/security-council.db');
  var runs = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM runs ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1').get();
  var findings = db.prepare('SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM findings WHERE run_id = ?').get(runs.id);
  var personas = db.prepare('SELECT persona, parsed_findings_count, duration_ms FROM persona_outputs WHERE run_id = ?').all(runs.id);
  console.log('Latest run:', JSON.stringify(runs, null, 2));
  console.log('Findings count:', findings.count);
  console.log('Persona outputs:', JSON.stringify(personas, null, 2));
  db.close();
"
```

Expected: Run record shows `status: 'completed'` with finding counts. Persona outputs show all 4 personas with non-zero `parsed_findings_count`.

If this fails: Check the run status. If `status: 'error'`, check the logs for the error message.

#### 6.3 Verify Telegram Alert Delivery `[GUIDED]`

Run a live (non-dry-run) test to verify Telegram delivery works. This sends a real summary message.

**Remote:**
```
cd ${WORKSPACE}/security-council && node scripts/security-council.js --json 2>&1
```

Expected: Telegram message received with the security council report summary. If there are critical findings, a separate critical alert should have been sent immediately.

If this fails:
- Check `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in the `.env` file
- Test the bot directly: `curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/sendMessage" -d "chat_id=${TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID}&text=Security Council test"`
- Verify the bot has permission to send messages to the chat ID

If DRY_RUN was used in 6.1 and you want to avoid running the full pipeline again, test Telegram separately:

**Remote:**
```
curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$(grep TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN ${WORKSPACE}/security-council/.env | cut -d= -f2)/sendMessage" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"chat_id\": \"$(grep TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID ${WORKSPACE}/security-council/.env | cut -d= -f2)\", \"text\": \"Security Council v2 test - Telegram delivery verified\"}"
```

#### 6.4 Verify Dedup Works `[AUTO]`

Run a second review and confirm that previously-seen findings are marked as recurring (not new).

**Remote:**
```
cd ${WORKSPACE}/security-council && node scripts/security-council.js --dry-run --json 2>&1 | python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
total = data.get('totalFindings', 0)
new_f = data.get('newFindings', 0)
print(f'Total findings: {total}')
print(f'New findings: {new_f}')
print(f'Recurring: {total - new_f}')
if total > 0 and new_f < total:
    print('DEDUP WORKING: Some findings correctly identified as recurring')
elif total > 0 and new_f == total:
    print('WARNING: All findings marked as new. Dedup may not be working if this is a re-run.')
else:
    print('No findings to evaluate dedup')
"
```

Expected: The second run should show fewer `newFindings` than `totalFindings`, with some findings marked as recurring. This confirms the SQLite dedup is working against the 7-day window.

If this fails: Check that the first run's findings were stored correctly (Step 6.2). The dedup compares by content hash (SHA-256 of title + description), so findings must have consistent titles.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set` | Missing or malformed `.env` file | Check `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/.env` exists with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...` |
| `better-sqlite3 not installed` | npm install failed | Run `cd ${WORKSPACE}/security-council && npm install`. May need Xcode CLT on macOS. |
| `collect-baseline.sh not found` | Script not installed or not executable | Check file exists and run `chmod +x` on it |
| API 401 error | Invalid API key | Verify key starts with `sk-ant-api03-`. OAuth tokens (`sk-ant-oat01-`) do NOT work for direct calls. |
| API 429 error | Rate limited | Wait and retry. Consider using a lower-tier model or adding delay between persona calls. |
| Empty findings from a persona | Model returned unparseable output | Check `persona_outputs` table for raw response. The parser tries multiple JSON extraction strategies. |
| Telegram not sending | Bot token or chat ID wrong | Test manually: `curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage" -d "chat_id=<ID>&text=test"` |
| launchd not firing | Plist not loaded or path wrong | Check `launchctl list \| grep security-council`. Verify all paths in plist are absolute. |
| launchd fires but script fails | Node path wrong in plist | Check `which node` and update the plist's ProgramArguments. Check stderr log at `${WORKSPACE}/security-council/logs/launchd-stderr.log`. |
| All findings always "new" | Dedup hash mismatch | Findings are hashed by title+description. If the AI generates slightly different text each run, dedup will not match. This is expected for AI-generated content -- the dedup catches identical findings. |
| HTML report not generated | `render-security-email.js` missing or has errors | Check file exists and run `node -e "require('./scripts/render-security-email.js')"` to verify no syntax errors. |
| Script crashes with ENOMEM | Baseline too large | The baseline is passed as a string to the API. If it exceeds model context, truncate in `collect-baseline.sh` (reduce `head` limits). |

## Dependencies

- **Depends on:** Node.js v18+, Anthropic API key, Telegram bot setup
- **Optionally enhanced by:** `deploy-himalaya-email.md` (for full HTML email reports), `deploy-security-safety.md` (provides additional baseline context)
- **Required by:** Nothing directly, but security findings can feed into `deploy-daily-briefing.md` if included in morning briefings
- **Replaces:** `deploy-security-council.md` (BLOCKED)

## Architecture Notes

### Why Standalone (Not OpenClaw Session)

The security council runs as a standalone Node.js script instead of inside an OpenClaw session because:

1. **Context overflow**: The baseline data alone can be 10-20KB of text. Running 4 persona analyses inside an OpenClaw session would consume the entire context window and cause degraded responses.
2. **Reliability**: Standalone scripts do not depend on the OpenClaw gateway being up. If the gateway crashes, security reviews still run.
3. **API key isolation**: The script uses its own `.env` file. No coupling to OpenClaw's auth-profiles.json or OAuth token refresh.
4. **Simpler debugging**: Logs are in a known location. No session state to reason about.

### Why Sequential (Not Parallel) Persona Execution

Unlike the advisory council which runs 8 personas in parallel, the security council runs its 3 analysis personas sequentially and then the operational realism filter last:

1. **API rate limits**: 4 simultaneous Claude API calls may hit rate limits on some API key tiers.
2. **Operational realism needs context**: The 4th persona MUST see the other 3 personas' findings to do its job (false positive filtering, blast radius assessment). It cannot run in parallel.
3. **Cost predictability**: Sequential execution gives clear per-persona cost attribution in the `persona_outputs` table.
4. **Error isolation**: If persona 2 hits an API error, personas 3 and 4 still run. With `Promise.all`, one failure rejects all.

### 7-Day Dedup Window (vs Advisory Council's 30 Days)

Security findings change faster than business insights. A 7-day window means:
- Fixed issues stop appearing after 1 week
- New variants of recurring issues are flagged
- The database stays smaller and queries stay fast
