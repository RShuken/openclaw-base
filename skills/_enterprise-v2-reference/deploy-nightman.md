# Deploy Nightman (Autonomous Overnight Workforce)

> **📌 REFERENCE SNAPSHOT — NOT FOR DEFAULT DEPLOYMENT.** This file was preserved from the {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} / {{COMPANY_NAME}} engagement as a reference example of how a custom office/VC deployment was built. **Do NOT install this skill as part of a generic OpenClaw deployment.** It may contain engagement-specific defaults (emails, chat IDs, team names, VC-flavored workflows), Claude Opus routing (we default to Codex per `audit/_baseline.md` §BB in the parent repo), or stale "Blocked Commands" claims from 2026.2.26 that were resolved in 2026.4.15+. Use as inspiration when building custom-office skills, not as a default.

## Compatibility
- **OpenClaw Version**: 2026.3.27+
- **Status**: DRAFT
- **Layer**: 0 (Foundation) — runs all night, feeds every morning skill
- **Architecture**: Standalone Node.js orchestrator + 30-minute recursive trigger cycle via launchd. Claude Opus 4.6 for deep thinking and project advancement. State management via SQLite. GitHub integration for autonomous dev work (never pushes to main — dev branches + PRs only).
- **Updated**: 2026-03-30 based on the operator's vision: "This is where the magic happens."

## Purpose

Deploy an autonomous overnight workforce that runs from 10 PM to 5 AM in 30-minute cycles. Each cycle, Nightman checks its task queue, picks up the highest-priority work, executes it, logs the results, and queues the next cycle. It's not a script that runs once — it's a **shift worker** that recursively processes work all night long.

**The vision (from the operator):** "Imagine a PA who's in a different country and is awake when you're asleep. While {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} sleeps, it enriches contacts, researches new approaches, advances projects, improves websites, thinks about what could be better. Every 30 minutes, it triggers a new session where it thinks deeply about it, looks at what it made in the past, and says, 'I can make that a little better.'"

**What makes this different from a nightly batch job:**
- Batch jobs run once and exit. Nightman runs **14 cycles** (10 PM - 5 AM, every 30 min).
- Each cycle is a fresh process (no context accumulation) that reads the state from the previous cycle.
- It's autonomous — it decides what to work on based on priority, what's incomplete, and what opportunities it sees.
- It uses **Claude Opus 4.6** for deep thinking — not Haiku or Sonnet. This is where you invest in the best brain.
- It has rules (never push to main, always create PRs, never send emails without approval) so it can work unsupervised.

## Schedule

### Evening Planning Phase (6:00 PM)

Before the night shift starts, Nightman runs a **planning session:**

```
6:00 PM — EVENING PLANNING (via EOD Summary integration)

1. Inventory tonight's work:
   - What tasks are queued? (calendar enrichment, contact research, project work)
   - What projects have active goals?
   - What GitHub repos have open issues or improvement targets?

2. Identify gaps:
   - "I need {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s priorities for the Boulder Roots website before I can advance it"
   - "The PortCo X metrics aren't in the system — can't draft the follow-up until they are"
   - "No goals defined for the Foundation website — should I research best practices?"

3. Send planning summary to {{EA_NAME}}/{{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} via Telegram:
   "Tonight's planned work:
    1. Calendar enrichment for tomorrow (3 meetings)
    2. Contact research: 5 unknown attendees
    3. Draft 2 overdue follow-up emails
    4. Boulder Roots website: improve sponsor page layout (PR to dev branch)
    5. KG maintenance + backup

    ⚠ Missing info:
    - No goals defined for Foundation website. Should I research approaches?
    - PortCo X metrics needed for John Smith follow-up.

    [Approve Plan] [Modify] [Add Tasks]"

4. {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}/{{EA_NAME}} can:
   - Approve the plan as-is
   - Add tasks ("Also research competitive sponsor portals")
   - Remove tasks ("Skip the Foundation website tonight")
   - Provide missing info ("Here are the PortCo X metrics: ...")
   - If no response by 10 PM, Nightman works from what it has
```

### Night Shift (10:00 PM — 5:00 AM)

14 cycles, every 30 minutes. Each cycle is a fresh process.

```
10:00 PM — Cycle 1: High-priority operational tasks
10:30 PM — Cycle 2: Calendar enrichment + contact research
11:00 PM — Cycle 3: Draft follow-up emails
11:30 PM — Cycle 4: KG maintenance + consistency checks
12:00 AM — Cycle 5: Project work — GitHub repos (dev branch)
12:30 AM — Cycle 6: Project work continues
 1:00 AM — Cycle 7: Strategic thinking (Opus deep analysis)
 1:30 AM — Cycle 8: Project work — improvements and PRs
 2:00 AM — Cycle 9: Contact enrichment (LinkedIn research)
 2:30 AM — Cycle 10: Project work continues
 3:00 AM — Cycle 11: Embedding refresh + KG updates
 3:30 AM — Cycle 12: Security Council audit
 4:00 AM — Cycle 13: Backup + final project work
 4:30 AM — Cycle 14: Night summary + handoff preparation
```

**This schedule is a guideline, not rigid.** Nightman's orchestrator decides what to work on each cycle based on:
- Priority queue (operational tasks first, then enrichment, then projects)
- What completed in previous cycles
- What failed and needs retry
- Time remaining until morning briefing

## State Management

Nightman maintains state across cycles via SQLite:

### `nightman-state.db`

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `task_queue` | All tasks for tonight: task_type, priority, status (queued/in_progress/completed/failed/skipped), cycle_started, cycle_completed, result_path |
| `cycle_log` | Log per cycle: cycle_number, started_at, completed_at, tasks_worked, tokens_used, errors |
| `project_state` | Per-project tracking: repo_url, branch, last_commit, goals[], current_status, pr_url, notes |
| `nightly_plan` | Tonight's plan (from 6 PM planning phase): approved_tasks, missing_info, dan_additions |
| `ideas` | Ideas generated during deep thinking: idea, project, priority, rationale, created_cycle |

### State File Handoff

Each cycle reads the state from the previous cycle and writes updated state:

```
Cycle N starts:
  1. Read nightman-state.db → what's done, what's pending, what failed
  2. Pick highest-priority incomplete task
  3. Execute task (with appropriate model — Opus for thinking, Sonnet for execution)
  4. Write results to data/nightman/YYYY-MM-DD/
  5. Update nightman-state.db → mark task complete, queue follow-ups
  6. Exit cleanly

Cycle N+1 starts 30 min later:
  1. Read nightman-state.db → picks up where Cycle N left off
  ...
```

No context accumulation between cycles. Each is a fresh process. State lives in the database.

## Task Categories

### Category 1: Operational (Highest Priority — runs first)

| Task | What | Model |
|------|------|-------|
| Calendar enrichment | Missing links, travel time, parking for next 48 hours | Sonnet |
| Contact research | Unknown attendees for tomorrow's meetings | Sonnet + Tavily |
| Draft follow-ups | Overdue action items → emails in {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s voice | Opus (voice quality) |
| KG maintenance | Edges, states, consistency, embeddings | Sonnet |
| Backup | Trigger Backup & Recovery skill | Script |

### Category 2: Project Work (GitHub Integration)

Nightman knows about the team's GitHub repos, what's being built, and what the goals are.

**How it works:**

```
For each project in project_state:

1. Read project goals (from config or {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s instructions)
   "Boulder Roots website: improve sponsor page layout, add mobile responsiveness"

2. Check GitHub repo status:
   - git pull latest from main
   - Read open issues and PRs
   - Check last Nightman commit on dev branch

3. Create or checkout dev branch:
   nightman/YYYY-MM-DD-{project-name}

4. Use Claude Opus to analyze the codebase:
   "Given these goals, what specific improvements can I make tonight?"

5. Make changes (code, content, styling, structure)

6. Commit to dev branch with clear message:
   "[Nightman] Improve sponsor page mobile layout — responsive grid, touch targets"

7. Create PR (or update existing) via GitHub API:
   Title: "[Nightman] Sponsor page improvements — March 31"
   Body: What was changed, why, screenshots if applicable
   Labels: nightman, auto-generated
   Target: main (for human review)

8. NEVER merge. NEVER push to main. PR sits for human review.
```

**Rules for project work (hard, non-negotiable):**
1. **Never push to main.** Always dev branch → PR.
2. **Never merge PRs.** Humans merge after review.
3. **Never delete files.** Only add or modify.
4. **Always create PRs** with clear descriptions of what changed and why.
5. **Label everything** `nightman` + `auto-generated` so the team knows it's AI work.
6. **Respect .gitignore.** Never commit .env, credentials, or large files.
7. **If unsure, document instead of code.** Write a markdown file explaining the idea rather than making a risky code change.

**Project goals are defined by {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}/{{EA_NAME}}** (via evening planning or config):

```json
// config/nightman-projects.json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "Boulder Roots Music Fest",
      "repo": "{{COMPANY_SLUG}}/boulder-roots-website",
      "branch_prefix": "nightman",
      "goals": [
        "Improve sponsor page layout for mobile",
        "Add sponsor tier descriptions",
        "Optimize images for page speed"
      ],
      "status": "active"
    },
    {
      "name": "Portfolio Dashboard",
      "repo": "{{COMPANY_SLUG}}/portfolio-dashboard",
      "branch_prefix": "nightman",
      "goals": [
        "Add quarterly performance charts",
        "Improve loading speed",
        "Fix responsive layout on tablet"
      ],
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Category 3: Strategic Thinking (Opus Deep Analysis)

One or two cycles per night dedicated to **deep thinking** with Claude Opus 4.6:

**What Opus thinks about:**

| Topic | Prompt Pattern |
|-------|---------------|
| Project ideas | "Given the current state of {project}, what could we do next? What would make this 10x better? Think beyond the current goals." |
| Contact strategy | "{{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} meets with {person} tomorrow. Given their relationship history and current deal state, what's the optimal approach? What should {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} ask? What should he offer?" |
| Competitive research | "The Boulder Roots Music Fest competes with {events}. What are they doing that we're not? What could we learn from their sponsor portals?" |
| Process improvement | "Looking at {{AGENT_NAME}}'s operational data from the last week: what's working? What's failing? What should we change?" |
| Proactive recommendations | "Based on {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s calendar, email patterns, and current projects — what's he not seeing? What's falling through the cracks? What opportunity is he missing?" |

Ideas are stored in the `ideas` table and surfaced in the morning briefing:

```
"💡 Nightman Idea (generated 1:30 AM, Opus):
 The Boulder Roots sponsor page currently lists sponsors alphabetically.
 Competitor analysis of 5 music festivals shows tiered visual layouts
 (logos sized by tier) convert 23% more sponsor inquiries. I've created
 a PR with a tiered layout concept: nightman/2026-03-31-sponsor-tiers
 [View PR] [Dismiss Idea]"
```

### Category 4: Recursive Improvement

Even "done" projects get revisited. Nightman asks:

- "This project is marked complete. But what if we pushed it further?"
- "The sponsor page is deployed. What would make it world-class?"
- "The dashboard loads in 2.1 seconds. Can we get it under 1 second?"

This is controlled by {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}/{{EA_NAME}} — they can mark a project as:
- `active` — Nightman works on defined goals
- `maintenance` — Nightman only fixes bugs and monitors
- `explore` — Nightman can explore improvements and create idea PRs
- `frozen` — Nightman doesn't touch it

This is what the 5:30 AM Morning Briefing reads.

## What Gets Installed

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Orchestrator | `scripts/nightman.js` | Main loop: reads state, picks task, executes, updates state |
| Planning script | `scripts/nightman-plan.js` | 6 PM planning phase → Telegram |
| Calendar enrichment | `scripts/nightman-calendar.js` | Task 1: Missing links, travel, parking |
| Contact research | `scripts/nightman-contacts.js` | Task 2: Tavily + CRM enrichment |
| Draft follow-ups | `scripts/nightman-followups.js` | Task 3: Overdue items → {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s voice |
| KG maintenance | `scripts/nightman-kg.js` | Task 4: Edges, states, consistency |
| Project worker | `scripts/nightman-project.js` | Task 5: GitHub repos, dev branches, PRs |
| Strategic thinker | `scripts/nightman-think.js` | Task 6: Opus deep analysis |
| Summary generator | `scripts/nightman-summary.js` | 4:30 AM: night summary + handoff |
| State DB | `data/nightman-state.db` | Task queue, cycle log, project state, ideas |
| Project config | `config/nightman-projects.json` | Repos, goals, branch rules |
| Config | `config/nightman.json` | Schedule, model selection, task priorities |
| Output dir | `data/nightman/YYYY-MM-DD/` | Nightly results (consumed by morning skills) |
| LaunchAgent (planner) | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.edge.nightman-plan.plist` | 6:00 PM daily |
| LaunchAgent (worker) | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.edge.nightman.plist` | Every 30 min, 10 PM - 5 AM |
| TOOLS.md | `TOOLS.md` | nightman_status, nightman_plan, add_project, nightman_ideas |

## Cost

| Component | Cost/Night |
|-----------|-----------|
| Claude Opus (strategic thinking, 2-3 cycles) | ~$1.50 |
| Claude Opus (draft follow-ups in {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s voice) | ~$0.50 |
| Claude Sonnet (operational tasks, 8-10 cycles) | ~$1.00 |
| Claude Opus (project work analysis + code, 3-4 cycles) | ~$2.00 |
| Tavily research (~10 lookups) | ~$0.10 |
| Google Maps API | ~$0.03 |
| oMLX embeddings | $0 |
| **Nightly total** | **~$5.13** |
| **Monthly** | **~$154** |

More expensive than the original $28/month estimate because we're using Opus for deep thinking and running 14 cycles instead of 1 batch. For a VC firm: $154/month for an autonomous overnight workforce that advances projects, enriches contacts, and generates strategic ideas. That's less than one hour of a junior analyst's time.
